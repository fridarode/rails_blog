Rails Blog
Goal:

To become familiar with the basics of Ruby on Rails

Assignment:

Build a basic blogging app in Rails.

There should be a User, Post, and Comment model.

The app should have similar functionality to Tumblr - users can login, write posts, comment on other users' posts, etc.

Work on this project while following the same process as with the micro-blogging app:

Sketch out the way your app will look
Create a basic repo, push to GitHub
Start coding
Grading Criteria:

User model sign up, in, login, edit, delete
Post and Comment model allow current user to post
Code is well commented and contains a README
